what is a single output location and why we need it?
- output location: a folder where the results of various tasks like lint, detekt, checkstyle, tests,
  etc are generated
- currently its in build directory of all modules
- it needs to be in single location otherwise our ci cd pipeline will be too long and
  too difficult to maintain. when new modules are added

how to achieve it?
- lint: supports custom output dir
- detekt : supports custom output dir
- checkstyle : supports custom output dir
- test: does not support by default, but can be configured using hacks
- aar/apk : need to research
- publish : not applicable

Why we are moving back to  multiple output dir?
- the hacks for lint and test makes it flaky . 1 in 5 times does not show in output directory
  correctly but rather in the original module's build dir
- when test fails, it always shows up in its original directory
- gradle lint sometimes don't work when output dir is provided
